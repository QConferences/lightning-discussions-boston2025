Are you working on an interesting project and would like feedback from other attendees? Are you looking to connect about a technical challenge your company is currently facing? Has your team uncovered insights about new and exciting technologies? **Share with your peers!**

**We are offering all conference attendees** the opportunity to propose a discussion topic or share about a project you are working on and connect with the community during break sessions.

## What is a Lightning Discussion? ##
